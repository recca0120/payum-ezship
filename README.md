The Payum extension to rapidly build new extensions.

1. Create new project

```bash
$ composer create-project payum-tw/ezship
```

2. Replace all occurrences of `payum` with your vendor name. It may be your github name, for now let's say you choose: `ezship`.
3. Replace all occurrences of `ezship` with a payment gateway name. For example Stripe, Paypal etc. For now let's say you choose: `ezship`.
4. Register a gateway factory to the payum's builder and create a gateway:

```php
<?php

use Payum\Core\PayumBuilder;
use Payum\Core\GatewayFactoryInterface;

$defaultConfig = [];

$payum = (new PayumBuilder)
    ->addGatewayFactory('ezship', function(array $config, GatewayFactoryInterface $coreGatewayFactory) {
        return new \PayumTW\Ezship\EzshipGatewayFactory($config, $coreGatewayFactory);
    })

    ->addGateway('ezship', [
        'factory' => 'ezship',
        'su_id' => null,
    ])

    ->getPayum();
```

5. While using the gateway implement all method where you get `Not implemented` exception:

```php
<?php

use Payum\Core\Request\Capture;

$ezship = $payum->getGateway('ezship');

$model = new \ArrayObject([
  // ...
]);

$ezship->execute(new Capture($model));
```
